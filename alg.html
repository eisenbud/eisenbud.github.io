		<td>The embedding theorem in Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory</td>
		<td> Abstract: Brill--Noether theory studies the maps of general curves to projective
spaces. The embedding theorem of Eisenbud and Harris states that a
general degree d map C to P^r is an embedding when r is at least 3.
Hurwitz--Brill--Noether theory starts with a curve C already equipped
with a fixed map C to P^1 (which often forces C to be special) and
then studies the maps of C to other projective spaces. In this
setting, the appropriate analogue of the invariants d and r is a finer
invariant called the splitting type. Our embedding theorem determines
the splitting types \vec{e} such that a general map of splitting type
\vec{e} is an embedding. This is joint work with Kaelin Cook--Powel,
Dave Jensen, Eric Larson, and Isabel Vogt./<td>

<th>I'll discuss two open problems about infinite resolutions,
  explain the ``Burch index'', 
  and prove that, if a local Artinian ring has Burch index at least 2, then the 7th syzygy of every module has a summand isomorphic to the
  residue field. This is joint work with Hai Long Dao.</th>

		<th>Weyman's generic free resolutions of length three</th>

<th>One approach to studying the structure of finite free resolutions is to construct and analyze universal examples. Unfortunately, Bruns proved that these examples typically do not exist---but they do if one weakens the standard notion of universality to allow for non-unique specialization. Weyman constructed such "generic" examples for length three resolutions, with a careful handling of this non-uniqueness. Moreover, this apparent defect of the construction actually endows the generic example with additional symmetry, from which a surprising connection to the ADE classification arises. I'll explain how this extra symmetry can be leveraged to better understand Weyman's generic example, and some of its applications to linkage and the structure theory of perfect ideals.

		<th>Doctrine-specific ur-algorithms</th>
		<th>
Various constructions of categories have a universal property expressing the freeness/initiality of the construction within a specific categorical doctrine. Expressed in an algorithmic framework, it turns out that this universal property is in a certain sense a doctrine-specific “ur-algorithm” from which various known categorical constructions/algorithms (including spectral sequences of bicomplexes) can be derived in a purely computational way. This can be viewed as a categorical version of the Curry-Howard correspondence to extract programs from proofs.
