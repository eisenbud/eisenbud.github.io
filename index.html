<h2>Academic Background</h2> 
After getting my PhD at the University of Chicago in 1970, 
I taught at Brandeis University for twenty-seven years,
with sabbaticals in Paris, Bonn, and Berkeley. In 1997 I
became Director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in
Berkeley; at the same time I joined the
faculty of UC Berkeley as Professor of Mathematics.
<p>
As Director of MSRI from 1997 to 2007, I had the satisfaction
of supporting a huge amount of mathematics and related activity
at the Institute, and in helping it develop two things I thought
it needed badly: a physical facility worthy of such a world-class
institution, and (the beginning of) an endowment.
From 2003 to 2005 I was also President of the American Mathematical
Society, an organization I came to admire a great deal. I was elected
Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006.
<p>
Robert Bryant succeeded me as Director of MSRI in 2007, and from then until
the fall of 2012 I divided my time between teaching at Berkeley and
working as Director of Mathematics and Physical Sciences at the Simons Foundation in New York,
where I initiated the public programs in Mathematics, Theoretical Physics, and
Theoretical Computer Science. 
<p>
I returned to MSRI in the year 2012-13 as an organizer of the year-long program on
Commutative Algebra, and became Director of MSRI again in August, 2013, in which role
I served until August, 2022. I have now gone "back" to teaching as Professor
in the department of mathematics at UC Berkeley.

<h2> Current Activities Outside MSRI</h2>

<h3>Organizational</h3>
<p>
I remain connected to the Simons Foundation as member, since 2012, of its Board of Directors; and I have been
on the Board of Directors of Math for America since its inception in 2004.
<p>
I helped found the 
<a href="http://msp.org/ant/about/cover/cover.html"> Journal of Algebra and 
Number Theory </a> in 2006, and the 
<a href="http://msp.org/jsag/about/cover/cover.html">Journal of Software for Algebra and
Geometry</a> in 2009, and I'm Chair of the Editorial Board of the former.
I'm also an editor of Springer-Verlag's book series 
<a href="http://www.springer.com/series/3339"> Algorithms and
Computation in Mathematics</a>.
<p>
While President of the AMS I helped plan the 
<a href="http://www.ams.org/programs/research-communities/mrc">Math Research Communities<a> Program,
and chaired its advisory board for several years.

<h3> Current Events Bulletin at the Winter AMS Meeting</h3> 
Since 2004 I've been organizing a session at each of the Winter
AMS meetings on Current Events in Mathematics. The format is simple:
four accessible 50-minute lectures on some of the most interesting
pure and applied mathematics of the last few years, presented by people
who are speaking on the work of others. The inspiration is of course the
famous Bourbaki Seminar, but the aim is to be broader and represent a
wider range of mathematics, particularly on the applied side. 
A <a
href="http://www.ams.org/ams/current-events-bulletin.html">
booklet</a> with writeups of the talks is available at the meeting
and online. Almost all of them become articles in the
<a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/"> Bulletin of
the American Mathematical Society </a> afterwards.
</ul>

<h3> Research Interests </h3>
<p>
My first paper was about permutation groups, and my thesis and
subsequent few papers on non-commutative ring theory (my thesis
advisors were Saunders MacLane and, unofficially, the English
ring-theorist J.C. Robson.) I turned to commutative algebra, and
subsequently to singularity theory, knot theory, and algebraic
geometry. My papers also
include one on a statistical application of algebraic geometry and one
on juggling. 

Recently I've worked on the homological aspects of commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry; and on computational tools for these fields.

<p> 
Ever since the early 70s I've used computers to produce
examples in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, and I've 
developed algorithms to extend the power of computation
in this area. In 2009 I joined Mike Stillman
and Dan Grayson as Co-PI on the grant to (further) develop the
<a href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2" >
Macaulay2 </a>  system for symbolic computation.
Some of the papers I'm proudest of were partly inspired by computations with 
that system.
<p>
<p>
<h3>Recreation</h3>
My interests outside mathematics include hiking, juggling, and, above
all, music. Originally a flutist, I now spend most of my musical time
singing art-songs (Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Debussy, ...) I broke
down and bought a digital camera in November 2001, and you can find 
some of the results (alas, not up-to-date!) on my <a href="photos/photo_galleries.html"> photo page.</a>

<h2>
Saunders Mac Lane: In Memoriam
</h2>
Saunders Mac Lane died on April 14, 2005. He was my thesis advisor---Irving
Kaplansky was his first student, I was nearly his last; perhaps John
Thompson is the most illustrious. I wrote a 
<a href="MacLane-Preface.pdf">
preface that contains some of my favorite stories about him
</a> 
for his 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Saunders-Mac-Lane-Mathematical-Autobiography/dp/1568811500">
Autobiogrphy
</a>, which
was originally published by
AK Peters. 
He was a great figure,
and very important for me personally.
</a>
</ul>
<h2> Some Ongoing Work</h2> 
Here
are some of my current mathematical projects:
<ul>
Joe Harris and I have finally finished a book that could be a
"second course" on algebraic geometry, taking intersection theory as a path through
which many important aspects of the subject can be introduced:
3264 and All That; Intersection Theory in Algebraic Geometry</a>.
It is being published by Cambridge University Press, and should appear in the spring of 2016.
<br>
<br>
	<li>
With Daniel Erman and Frank Schreyer I'm working on understanding the analogues of Tate resolutions for Toric varieties. The case of projective space is explained in a paper of mine with Floystad and Schreyer some years ago.
 In November 2014, Erman and Schreyer and I posted a preprint solving the problem for the "easiest difficult" case -- Products of projective spaces.

<br>
<br>
	<li>
Irena Peeva succeeded in fulfilling a dream of many years: we found a good analogue
for complete intersections of the description of minimal free resolutions over hypersurfaces by
matrix factorizations. There are many questions that are opened up by this work, and
Frank Schreyer and Jesse Burke have joined us on various aspects of the 
project that are still developing.
<br>
<br>
	<li>
With Bernd Ulrich and Marc Chardin I've done some work on residual intersections. The latest
preprint is <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2050">Duality and Socle Generators for Residual Intersections</a>. This is a greatly expanded and improved version of a preprint we posted at the end of the 
MSRI Commutative Algebra year, 2012-13. The whole project was inspired by work of
Duco van Straten and Huneke-Ulrich, who discoverd two pieces in what turns out to be a whole
series of dualities, and by conjectures of van Straten and Warmt that the socle of the canonical 
module of a residual intersection is, under good circumstances, defined by a Jacobian determinant.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>
With Jeremy Gray I'm working on a biographical paper about the life 
and work of F.S. Macaulay. Though his work contains aspects that
look quite various, I think there's a very strong underlying thread
that can be traced from the early work on plane curves right
through his invention (in the graded case) of the notion of what we now call
a Gorentstein ring.
</ul>
I am grateful to the National Scienced Foundation for partial support
in my work on these projects!

<h2>Commutative Algebra Book</h2> 
My book, "Commutative
Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry", published in 1995 by
<a href="http://www.springer-ny.com">Springer-Verlag</a>,
won the AMS's 
<a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/201004/rtx100400510p.pdf">
Leroy P. Steele Prize for Exposition</a> in 2010. 
<p>
Here are some correction lists:
<ul>
<li>
Inserted in the  second (1996) printing (<a
href="corrections1-2.text"> TeX source</a>, <a href="corr1-2.pdf">
pdf</a>)
<li>
Inserted in the third (1999) printing (<a
href="corrections2-3.text">TeX source</a>, <a href="corr2-3.pdf">
pdf</a>). Note that the page numbers changed a little between the
first and second printings.
</ul>
The pages above are now rather out-of-date; this is a project
I'll get to sooner or later. But if you are aware of further corrections
or have any comments, I hope you'll send
them to me.
