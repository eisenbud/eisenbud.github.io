<h2>Academic Background</h2> 
After getting my PhD at the University of Chicago in 1970, 
I taught at Brandeis University for twenty-seven years,
with sabbaticals in Paris, Bonn, and Berkeley. In 1997 I
became Director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in
Berkeley; at the same time I joined the
faculty of UC Berkeley as Professor of Mathematics.
<p>
As Director of MSRI from 1997 to 2007, I had the satisfaction
of supporting a huge amount of mathematics and related activity
at the Institute.
From 2003 to 2005 I was also President of the American Mathematical
Society, an organization I came to admire a great deal. I was elected
Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006.
<p>
Robert Bryant succeeded me as Director of MSRI in 2007, and from then until
the fall of 2012 I divided my time between teaching at Berkeley and
working as the first Director of Mathematics and Physical Sciences at the Simons Foundation in New York,
where I initiated the public programs in Mathematics, Theoretical Physics, and
Theoretical Computer Science. 
<p>
I returned to MSRI in the year 2012-13 as an organizer of the year-long program on
Commutative Algebra, and became Director of MSRI again in August, 2013, in which role
I served until August, 2022. I have now gone "back" to teaching as Professor
in the department of mathematics at UC Berkeley.
<p>
When I applied to become the Director of MSRI I wrote to the hiring
committee saying that, while the strength of MSRI's scientific program was
already recognized around the world, I felt that MSRI badly needed two things:
 a physical facility worthy of such a world-class
institution (and in particular
a better auditorium);
and an endowment that could enable long-term planning and protect the
institution from possible future fluctuations in NSF support,
which was essentially the only source of funding at the time.
<p>
Now, in my retirement from the directorship, I have the satisfaction of
having helped bring about both of these changes: The renovation and
extension of the building to approximately twice its original size
was accomplished in 2006, near the end of my first two terms, and a
centerpiece of the construction was the beautiful and airy Simons auditorium,
where Roger Penrose gave the inaugural lecture in 2006
 <img align="right" src="SimonsAuditoriumInauguralLecture.jpeg" 
      alt="Simons Auditorium Innaugural Lecture" width="485" height="502" hspace="30">
 <p>
Jim Simons made the first substantial contribution to the Endowment, including
the establishment of the "Eisenbud Professorship" at MSRI, at my retirement
 party in 2007. I undertook a major endowment campaign in my fourth term,
 and as I leave MSRI, its endowment stands at about $130 million; the
 extraordinary generosity of the lead gifts made by Jim and Marilyn Simons
 and matched by
 Henry and Marsha Laufer, led to the renaming of MSRI as the
 Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute, or SLMath for short.

MSRI's biggest outreach projects on my watch were the National Math Festivals
held in the spring of 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2021 as joint projects with the Institute for Advanced Study. I worked very closely with MSRI staffmember Kirsten Bohl, whose energy, skill, and sensitivity made these programs a great success,
each one drawing over 12,000 kids and adults to the Washington Convention Center. Here is a typical scene:

<h2> Activities Outside Berkeley</h2>

<h3>Organizational</h3>
<p>
I remain connected to the Simons Foundation as member, since 2012, of its Board of Directors; and I have been
on the Board of Directors of Math for America since its inception in 2004.
<p>
I helped found the 
<a href="http://msp.org/ant/about/cover/cover.html"> Journal of Algebra and 
Number Theory</a> in 2006, and the 
<a href="http://msp.org/jsag/about/cover/cover.html">Journal of Software for Algebra and
Geometry</a> in 2009, and I'm Chair of the Editorial Board of the former.
I'm also an editor of Springer-Verlag's book series
<a href="http://www.springer.com/series/136"> Graduate Texts in Mathematics</a> and 
<a href="http://www.springer.com/series/3339"> Algorithms and
Computation in Mathematics</a>
<p>
While President of the AMS I helped plan the 
<a href="http://www.ams.org/programs/research-communities/mrc">Math Research Communities<a> Program,
and chaired its advisory board for several years.

<h3> Current Events Bulletin at the Winter AMS Meeting</h3> 
Since 2004 I've been organizing a session at each of the Winter
AMS meetings on Current Events in Mathematics. The format is simple:
four accessible 50-minute lectures on some of the most interesting
pure and applied mathematics of the last few years, presented by people
who are speaking on the work of others. The inspiration is of course the
famous Bourbaki Seminar, but the aim is to be broader and represent a
wider range of mathematics, particularly on the applied side. 
A <a
href="http://www.ams.org/ams/current-events-bulletin.html">
  booklet</a> with writeups of the talks is permanently available
online. Almost all of them become articles in the
<a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/"> Bulletin of
the American Mathematical Society</a> afterwards.
</ul>

<h3> Research Interests </h3>
<p>
My first paper was about permutation groups, and my thesis and
subsequent few papers on non-commutative ring theory (my thesis
advisors were Saunders MacLane and, unofficially, the English
ring-theorist J.C. Robson.) I turned to commutative algebra, and
subsequently to singularity theory, knot theory, and algebraic
geometry. My papers also
include one on a statistical application of algebraic geometry and one
on juggling. 

Recently I've worked on the homological aspects of commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry; and on computational tools for these fields:
<p> 
Ever since the early 70s I've used computers to produce
examples in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, and I've 
developed algorithms to extend the power of computation
in this area. In 2009 I joined Mike Stillman
and Dan Grayson as Co-PI on the grant to (further) develop the
<a href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2" >
Macaulay2</a>  system for symbolic computation.
Some of the papers I'm proudest of were partly inspired by computations with 
that system.
<p>
<p>
<h3>Recreation</h3>
My interests outside mathematics include hiking, juggling, and, above
all, music. Originally a flutist, I now spend most of my musical time
singing art-songs (Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Debussy, ...) I broke
down and bought a digital camera in November 2001, and you can find 
some of the results (alas, not up-to-date!) on my <a href="photos/photo_galleries.html"> photo page</a>.

<h3>Saunders Mac Lane: In Memoriam
</h3>
Saunders Mac Lane died on April 14, 2005. He was my thesis advisor---Irving
Kaplansky was his first student, I was nearly his last; perhaps John
Thompson is the most illustrious. I wrote a
preface that contains some of my favorite 
<a href="MacLane-Preface.pdf">
stories</a>  
about him for his 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Saunders-Mac-Lane-Mathematical-Autobiography/dp/1568811500">
Autobiography</a>, which
was originally published by
AK Peters. 
He was a great figure,
and very important for me personally.

    David Buchsbaum
    <h3>
David Buchsbaum was my postdoctoral mentor at Brandeis, and we worked closely together for most of the first 10 years
of my career. In addition to math, we spent a lot of time discussing department and university politics, and the
history of the math department, great preparation for my future administrative activity.
When he died in January 2021, at the age of 91, his former student Jerzy Weyman and I collected reminiscences from
many of David's friends and students, and published them along with lots of photos in
  <a href="RememberingBuchsbaum.pdf">Remembering David Buchsbaum</a>, 
which was published in the
    Notices of the American Mathematical Society.

It was my privilege to get to know Yuri Manin, and even to interview him for
the Simons Foundation's

I contributed
an couple of memories of our friendship to the

<h2> Some Ongoing Work</h2> 
Here
are some of my current mathematical projects:
<li>

  Joe Harris and I are working on a new book, and I hope it will be ready for a copy-editor's attention this summer.
  Tentatively titled ``Practical Curves", we hope it serve to introduce a number of topics in the theory of
  projective algebraic curves. Most books on this subject end with the Riemann-Roch theorem; that is where our book
  will start. Our original impulse was to write a grown-up book on curves parallel to Beauville's beautiful book
  on algebraic surfaces. Thus we are aiming for a much less complete (and less lengthy) treatment than that of
  the great two-volume work of Arbarello, Cornalba, Griffiths and (for part 1) Harris.
  <br>
  
  Our previous book was
  3264 and All That; Intersection Theory in Algebraic Geometry</a>. Intended as a second course on algebraic geometry, it takes intersection theory as a path through
which many important aspects of the subject can be introduced.
It was published by Cambridge University Press in the spring of 2016.

Here are <a href="3264 solutions.pdf"> solutions</a> to a large proportion of the exercises.

<br>
<br>
	
	<li>
	  With Marc Chardin, Craig Huneke, and Bernd Ulrich I've done some work on residual intersections. The most recent 
	  work is related to residual intersections in the first serious case beyond the ones satisfying the ``Artin-Nagata'' conditions that guarantee
	  the Cohen-Macaulay property for residual intersections: the ideals of 2 x 2 minors of generic 2 x n matrices.
	  
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>
	  With Jeremy Gray I'm working on a biographical paper (for mathematicians) and
	  book (for historians) about the life 
and work of F.S. Macaulay. Though his work contains aspects that
look quite various, I think there's a very strong underlying thread
that can be traced from the early work on plane curves right
through his invention (in the graded case) of the notion of what we now call
a Gorentstein ring.

	  <br>
<br>
	<ul>
	<li>
	  With Hai Long Dao I've been working on infinite free resolutions. Most of the work on this
	  over the past 40 years has focussed on the numerical growth of the free modules
	  in the resolution; we are instead looking for regularities (or peculiarities)
	  in the maps.


</ul>
I am grateful to the National Science Foundation for partial support
	in my work on these projects!

	

<h2>Commutative Algebra Book</h2> 
My book, "Commutative
Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry", published in 1995 by
<a href="http://www.springer-ny.com">Springer-Verlag</a>,
won the AMS's 
<a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/201004/rtx100400510p.pdf">
Leroy P. Steele Prize for Exposition</a> in 2010. 
<p>
Here are some correction lists:
<ul>
<li>
Inserted in the  second (1996) printing (<a
href="corrections1-2.text"> TeX source</a>, <a href="corr1-2.pdf">
pdf</a>)
<li>
Inserted in the third (1999) printing (<a
href="corrections2-3.text">TeX source</a>, <a href="corr2-3.pdf">
pdf</a>). Note that the page numbers changed a little between the
first and second printings.
</ul>
The pages above are now rather out-of-date; this is a project
I'll get to sooner or later. But if you are aware of further corrections
or have any comments, I hope you'll send
them to me.
